# Hospitality-Domain-Revenue-Analysis

**Problem Statement :** This AtliQ Grands(Imaginary) owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a startegic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to  incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

**Metrics:**
1. Created Filters by City, Room Type, Booking Platforms, Months, Week Num and Property on the top of the vizualisation dashboard.
2. Created a basic Metrics Dashboard which consists of Total Revenue Generated by AtliQ Grands, RevPAR (Revenue Per Avaialable Room), DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights), DURN (Daily Utlized Room Nights)
